We have a global frame table to store the information about the memory available in the system, each frame table entry will store the physical address and a bit to keep track of whether a frame is used or not.
We also have a global hash page table to store the entries. Each page table entry will store the virtual page number, physical frame number, process id and a dirty bit.
Both frame table and page table will be initialized in vm_bootstrap().
-----------------Memory management----------------
The frame table will record the memory available in the system.It will devide the memory into many frames and keep track of whether it is used or not.
The alloc_kpages() and free_kpages() will mark certain memory frame into 'used' or 'unused'.
-------------Address space management-------------
----------------Address translation---------------
We implement a hashed page table to acheieve the goal.
